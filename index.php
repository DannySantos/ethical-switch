		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		
		<div class="our-story-box">
		
			<p>
				Ethical Switch began because we noticed something. No matter how hard you try, consuming ethically is always a difficult and time-consuming task 
				that many of us are too busy to take on. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Australians spent an estimated $642bn in 2012*. Our dream is to live in a world where that money goes not to the companies that are just out to 
				earn a buck, but to those who are actually doing good things.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				We hope to achieve this dream by empowering you, the consumer - by giving you the information you need to make sure that your hard-earned portion 
				of that money goes to the companies that deserve it.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				So we decided to create a company that would research the most ethical companies, display the information for you to easily read, and offer quick 
				and simple switches. We also made sure that a vast portion of our profits go to our charity partners - every time somebody makes a switch, we 
				donate.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In June 2014 a group of volunteers with a shared vision got together and built the foundation of what would eventually become Ethical Switch
				as it exists today.
			</p>
	
		</div>
		
		<div class="our-story-box">
		
			<p>
				Based in Fitzroy, in the heart of Melbourne's social enterprise scene, the Ethical Switch team work from our co-work space. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				We already have information about ethical power in Australia as well as an option to switch via our website, helping one of our charity projects 
				in the process.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In the next few months we will also be launching ethical banking and offering a switch for that too. After that we will continue to research 
				ethical companies and let you know every time we have a recommendation.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Subscribe to our list to be the first to hear about our new products or even better - find out who the most ethical power provider in your area is!
			</p>
		
			<p>
				After you've made your first switch you'll know what we mean when we say switching never felt better.
