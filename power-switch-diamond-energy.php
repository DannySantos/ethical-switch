							Yes, you can always switch your provider. It’s possible your existent contracts will require you to pay an exit fee but they

						<p>
							Diamond Energy handle it for you, including contacting your existing retailer.  If you are on a contract

						</p>
						
						<p>							
							If you are eligible for a net feed in tariff, they will top it up with their standard rate (currently 
							8c/kWh) - one of the highest available.
