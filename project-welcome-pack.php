			The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), located in Melbourne, furnishes much needed support to asylum seekers from the moment they arrive in Australia until 
			their refugee status is determined. The ASRC was founded in 2001 and is a vibrant community centre giving support in the form of food, clothing, legal, health, 
			support, education and emotional counselling and, just as importantly, provides a space for recreational and social activity underpinning the mental well-being 
			of each person that sets foot through the door.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Men, women and children often arrive in Australia after experiencing physical and mental torture, trauma and persecution in their country of origin, leaving 
			them with multiple, complex physical and mental health problems on their arrival. Many are blocked from to receiving Centrelink support and are not permitted 
			to work while they await the outcome of their refugee application. This can take anywhere from a few months to several years, piling further intense stress 
			onto them via the intense fear and uncertainty of whether they will be returned to potential danger and persecution in their home country.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The ASRC is made up of 57 staff and over 1,000 volunteers - with another 2000 volunteers on a waiting list. The volunteers are a cheerful, positive presence and 
			assist in all facets of the ASRC including cooking and cleaning, legal and medical assistance, psychological counselling, employment assistance, and are also a 
			friendly face for those coming to the ASRC for assistance.
