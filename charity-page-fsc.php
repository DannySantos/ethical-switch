			What makes FSC unique is that we were founded - and are still operated by - environmentalists, social interest groups, 
			indigenous peoples' organisations, responsible retailers and lead forest management companies. As a non-profit membership 
			based organisation we are driven by the balanced perspectives of these diverse stakeholders.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Through our 10 principles and criteria we ensure that forests are managed in a way that not only takes care of the animals 
			and plants that call it home, but also workers and local communities who rely on forests, and indigenous groups whose 
			heritage connects them to forest landscapes. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Our trusted logo can be found all around the world and provides international recognition to organisations who support 
			the growth of responsible forest management.
