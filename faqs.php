				Why switch via Ethical Switch?
			</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Ethical Switch provides the information you need to make the best choice of which company to switch to, including how aligned companies are to 
			the values we hold. If you make the switch via Ethical Switch then not only will we keep you updated on any new information, and adapt to any 
			changes, but when you make the switch we will make a donation on your behalf to one of our current charity partners.

		<h4>
			<a id="arent-ethical-products-and-suppliers-usually-more-expensive">
				Aren’t ethical products and suppliers usually more expensive?
			</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			The short answer: no!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is a myth that perhaps has been true at times in the past, but not today. If you look at our criteria tables you will see that many of the more 
			ethical companies provide some of the most affordable services in the market.

		<h4>
			<a id="what-benefit-does-ethical-switch-receive-if-i-switch">
				What benefit does Ethical Switch receive if I switch?
			</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Like other comparison websites, when you switch via our service we receive a commission fee from that company.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The difference with our service is that we only offer to switch people to  the most ethical companies in the market and because we are a  social 
			enterprise model,  we donate as much of our commission as we can (>80% profits) to our current charity partners.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In fact according to our fundraising licence, Ethical Switch Pty Ltd will donate not less than 40% from its sign up rewards fee to its nominated 
			beneficiaries where a customer signs a contract to use one of our providers.

			We would all rather that the money we spent didn’t cause any harm which is why we have researched which companies are having a positive effect in 
			society. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you would rather be with a power company that considers its effect on the environment, treats its customers well, prices its products fairly 
			and works hard to do good then simply use our criteria tables to choose your new power provider and make the switch.

		<h4>
			<a id="can-i-switch-if-im-already-on-a-contract">
				Can I switch if I’m already on a contract?

		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Yes, you can always switch your provider. It’s possible your existent contracts will require you to pay an exit fee but they are usually small 
			amounts (between $25 and $75). 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="underline">Powershop</span>
			
			<br />
			
			If you switch to Powershop then they will pay that fee for you up to $75 (which is likely to be more than enough to cover your whole exit fee). 
			You can see how much certain power companies charge for exit fees on our criteria tables.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="underline">Diamond Energy</span>
			
			<br />
			
			If you have been with Diamond Energy for over a year then it is unlikely you will have to pay an exit fee. If you have
			been with Diamond Energy for less than a year then your exit fee will most likely be $22.

			<span class="underline">Powershop</span>

			Powershop were found to be Victoria’s cheapest power provider on average according to a report by the Essential Services 
			Commission in 2014.
		</p>

		<p>
			The report showed that in Victoria Powershop’s prices were cheapest in 11 of the 15 residential 
			scenarios shown, and Powershop was within the cheapest 3 in all 15 scenarios.	
		</p>

			Diamond Energy is the solar friendly electricity retailer and service thousands of solar customers 
			across the country by offering some of the most competitive rates and one of the highest feed in 
			rates. Their discounts also apply to the charges before any solar credits.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you are one of the early adopter households who recognised the benefits of solar years ago, 
			then you may be already receiving a state based feed in tariff under a scheme that is now closed 
			to new recipients. Subject to eligibility check, you will continue to receive your feed in tariff when 
			you switch.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you are eligible for a net feed in tariff, they will top it up with their standard rate (currently 
			8c/kWh) - one of the highest available.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="underline">Powershop</span>
			
			<br />
			
			Powershop supports residential solar. Customers entitled to the Premium Feed-in Tariff, Transitional Feed-in Tariff, or the current Feed-in Tariff 
			will not lose access to their entitlements. If you are entitled to the old “one for one” Standard Feed-in Tariff that was available to households 
			installing solar generation before 31 December 2012, you will lose access to it by switching retailers, and will revert to the current Feed-in Tariff. 
			Please visit Victoria’s Energy and Resources website about standard feed-in tariffs for more information.

			<a id="where-will-my-power-actually-come-from">
				Where will my power actually come from?
			</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Electricity is energy, and the Australian grid is an ever changing mix of the energy supplied into it. This energy 
			can be locally sourced, renewable or from fossil fuel generators. Currently the National Energy Market (NEM) mix is 
			only ~13% renewable sourced, with the rest coming from fossil fuels. No matter which energy retailer you buy your 
			electricity from, the electricity is delivered via your distributor from the mix of energy present in your local 
			area, for ease this is measured by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) centrally, for each state, while 
			the NEM extends across the eastern seaboard from SA across Qld through to Tasmania. To help manage their business, 
			electricity retailers have a range of ways to source their electricity, including buying from the NEM or by sourcing 
			electricity directly from generators. The government mandates that a certain percentage of the electricity in the NEM 
			comes from renewable sources.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="underline">Powershop</span>
			
			<br />
			
			Powershop buys its electricity, like all retailers, from the NEM. However, Powershop is backed by Meridian Energy which owns and runs the Mt Miller 
			wind farm, which is situated on the Eyre Peninsular in South Australia. Mt Miller wind farm produces around 180 GWh of renewable energy per year. 
			They also own the Mt Mercer wind farm near Ballarat which has just begun generating enough electricity to supply over 100,000 households. These wind 
			farms produce more renewable power than Powershop’s customers consume. By purchasing power from Powershop you are supporting Meridian Energy and its 
			investment in renewable energy generation in Australia.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="underline">Diamond</span>
			
			<br />
			
			Diamond Energy sources electricity from renewable generators only, including their own Tatura and Shepparton biogas 
			plants, two solar plants in Mildura, a food waste to energy facility in outer Sydney, wind in South Australia and 
			from thousands of residential solar customer rooftops. They believe that clean and efficient renewable generation is 
			going to play an increasing role in Australia’s future energy mix and a major role in helping combat climate change, 
			ahead of old and tired coal generation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Their vision is to ‘generate change’ as an electricity retailer supporting renewable generation derived from 
			Australia’s pure, natural resources.   They also believe that by supporting Diamond Energy, customers can take 
			a simple step to make their electricity spend count. Every day they are supporting renewable generation whilst 
			enjoying competitive rates and great service for their homes and businesses

		<h4>
			<a id="what-is-greenpower">
				What is GreenPower?
			</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			The GreenPower Program is a government managed scheme that enables Australian households and businesses to displace their electricity usage with 
			certified renewable energy, which is added to the grid on their behalf.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			With each of our switches, you may optionally select GreenPower and this will help increase the demand for renewable energy in Australia.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When you select GreenPower you are forcing your electricity provider to buy more certified renewable energy than government mandated via the RET 
			scheme.  This helps drive investment in renewable energy in Australia!

			The Renewable Energy Target is a policy that encourages the development of renewable energy in Australia. It does this by requiring certain businesses,

			stations, such as wind farms, that are accredited by the Clean Energy Regulator.
